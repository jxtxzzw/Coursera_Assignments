This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function.  The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary."
