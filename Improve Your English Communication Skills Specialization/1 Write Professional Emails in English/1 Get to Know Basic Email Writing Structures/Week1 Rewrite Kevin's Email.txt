Subject: Request to cancel the order and ask for refund
To Whom It May Concern, 
My name is Kevin Johnson, and I ordered an office chair last week. Now, I would like to ask to cancel this order (Date: Jan 3rd, 2021; Order ID: XXXXX).
I would like to know if you could kindly help me deal with the refund? You could just use my payment account (Card XXXX of XXX bank).
Please let my know if there is anything I need to provide you, and wish you a happy day.
Thanks,
Kevin
